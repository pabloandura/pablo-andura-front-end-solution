# Introduction to my take on the challenge!

by Pablo Andura


## Short summary

I noticed each folder had `html` files with the acceptance criteria. So I hacked them a little bit to provide the most simple and familiar reviewing experience.
For the svelte section I have the `svelte-solution` folder which is a sibling of this documentation, you can look at the README.md file in there for more information.


## Workflow

### First steps

Initially I worked on all four HTML + CSS + JS challenges. 

I pondered along the way how to include these inside of an SPA with Svelte. They really are a Set, they could all be in one page!

We will worry about that after completing our, previously mentioned, first part of the challenge.

### Challenge 1 - Navigation Hover

For this challenged I was tempted to put underlines and fancy fade in/out animations but then I noticed that our reference Image showed a detail. 

Navigation Items that were not selected did not display much transition at all, it seemed static/unchanged upon its `hover state`.

Therefore I took that seriously and I attempted to recreate the same but with interactivity!
